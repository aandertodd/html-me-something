                    <p>The Vanilla Beans are very special to me. Frontman/songwriter Andrew Garces has been a friend of mine since
                        English 101 during my freshmen year of highschool. I had already adored this band for a few years and was lucky enough to be asked
                        to join in early 2011. Alongside Andrew (3 of 5, Honeydew) and myself is Ani Kramer (Honeydew, Details) on Moog and vocals.
                    </p>

                    <p>Shady Bug is the newest project I'm in. Some call it "the closest thing STL has to a super group." Once again, another project I'm exremely
                        thankful to be a part of. Having been a huge fan of singer/guitarist Hannah Rainey's other sister duo, Dubb Nubb, I was asked to play bass in this
                        new rock band she wanted to start. Since the band started in December, 2016,
                        we've already put out a tape and toured twice. Other members are Tom Krenning (Persh) and
                        Aaron O'neil(A leaf in the Street, Early Worm, Jonsei).
                    </p>

                    <p>I Could Sleep in the Clouds is something I started years ago with a friend. Before I was in the STL music scene, if I wanted to be creative my options were mostly
                            limited to just writing little songs in my room. Over the years I have been fortunate to know an array of talented musicians who have
                            sat in and played these songs live. This is just something I do when my other bands aren't busy and when people are kind enough to ask me to play. Current
                            and current/past members and contributors include: Kaleb Kirby, Coby Sher, John Hams, Ani Kramer, Liz Mahood, Andrew Garces, Chris Rogers, Sean Ballard, Ian McGowan,
                            Josiah Joyce, Bill Hudgins, and others...
